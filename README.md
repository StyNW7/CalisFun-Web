### **Architecture Principles**

The architecture for the **CalisFun Web Frontend** follows a **Layered Architecture** with emphasis on **scalability, reusability, and maintainability**.

1. **Layered Architecture Pattern**

    * Presentation Layer (UI): components, layouts, and pages folder
    * Application Layer (State & Orchestration Layer): context and hooks folder
    * Domain Layer (Business): services, utility, and lib folder
    * Infrastructure Layer: types, tests, public, assets folder

2. **Component-First**

   * `components/` holds reusable UI building blocks (buttons, cards, forms).
   * `layouts/` defines page skeletons (Landing, Dashboard).
   * `pages/` contain high-level views that orchestrate components.

3. **Separation of Concerns**

   * `services/` → communication layer for backend API.
   * `context/` → global state & role-based access (parent, child, admin).
   * `hooks/` → encapsulate reusable logic for cleaner components.
   * `utility/` → shared utilities (formatting, constants, validation).

4. **Scalability in Mind**

   * `types/` → enforce strong typing with TypeScript.
   * `tests/` → ensure testability with Jest/Vitest.
   * `assets/` → central location for images/icons for consistency.

5. **Vite + React + TS Setup**

   * `main.tsx` → bootstraps React.
   * `App.tsx` → app-wide routing & layout injection.
   * Integrated with **shadcn/ui** + **TailwindCSS** for clean and modern UI.

## 🎨 Design Pattern

The CalisFun Web Frontend applies common **software design patterns** (Creational, Structural, and Behavioral) to ensure scalability and maintainability:

### 🔨 Creational Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**  
  - Applied in global contexts (e.g., `AuthContext`) to ensure only **one instance** of state is shared across the app.  
  - Guarantees consistent authentication state 

- **Factory Pattern**  
  - Used in UI component generation (e.g., dynamic form fields, button variants via `shadcn/ui`).  
  - Enables creating multiple styled components from a single factory function.  

---

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns
- **Module Pattern**  
  - Each feature is modularized (`/services`, `/hooks`, `/pages`) for better separation of concerns.  
  - Improves scalability when new modules (e.g., new quiz type) are introduced.  

- **Facade Pattern**  
  - `services/` layer acts as a simplified interface for complex backend/AI API calls.  
  - Hides low-level HTTP details and provides clean functions like `loginUser()`, `fetchLeaderboard()`.  

---

### 🤝 Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**  
  - React’s state and context system naturally implement the observer pattern: when state changes, subscribed components automatically update.

- **Command Pattern**  
  - User interactions (button clicks, form submissions) are encapsulated as discrete actions handled by event handlers.  
  - Decouples UI elements from the logic execution.  

- **Mediator Pattern**  
  - The `context/` provider acts as mediator between unrelated components (e.g., AdminDashboard ↔ UserProfile), reducing direct dependencies.  

By combining these **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral** patterns, the frontend architecture remains **modular, testable, and extensible**, while ensuring smooth collaboration between UI components, business logic, and backend APIs.

---

## 🧼 Clean Code Principles

To ensure maintainability and readability, we enforce **Clean Code Principles**:

- **Naming Conventions**  
  - Variables, functions, and components use clear, descriptive names.  
  - Follows **camelCase** for variables/functions and **PascalCase** for React components.  

- **Small & Focused Components**  
  - Each component does **one thing well**.  
  - Large pages are broken down into smaller, reusable UI blocks.  

- **Consistent Styling**  
  - Unified design system via **TailwindCSS** + `shadcn/ui`.  
  - Global styles are minimized; utility classes ensure consistency.  

- **Linting & Formatting**  
  - Enforced with **ESLint** and **Prettier** to maintain consistent code style.  
  - CI/CD pipeline blocks PRs if linting/tests fail.  

- **Type Safety**  
  - Strongly typed with **TypeScript**.  
  - All shared contracts/interfaces live under `/src/types/`.  

- **Testing**  
  - Unit and integration tests in `/src/tests/`.  
  - Ensures critical features (auth, forms, dashboard) are always reliable.  

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  - Logic (hooks, services) is decoupled from UI (components).  
  - Pages orchestrate multiple components instead of holding business logic.

## 🔒 Security

The CalisFun Web Frontend implements multiple security measures to ensure safe usage:

- **JWT Authentication**  
  - All API requests to backend services are authenticated using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.  

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - Different roles (Guest User and Admin) have limited access.  
  - Admin Dashboard is protected by strict role verification and server-side validation.    

- **Secure Communication**  
  - All requests are sent over **HTTPS**.  
  - API keys and secrets are not hardcoded but injected via **environment variables**.  

- **Additional Frontend Security**  
  - ESLint + TypeScript to catch potential unsafe code.  
  - Regular dependency audit (`npm audit`) to identify vulnerabilities.  

---

## 📝 CI/CD

The CI/CD pipeline for CalisFun Web Frontend is designed to ensure **automation, reliability, and fast iteration**:

- **GitHub Actions (Workflows)**  
  - Runs automated tests (unit + integration) on every `pull request` and `main` branch push.  
  - Performs **linting & build check** to ensure code quality.  
  - Generates coverage reports under `/coverage`.  

- **Vercel Deployment**  
  - Integrated with **Vercel** for seamless frontend hosting.  
  - Every push to `main` branch triggers an automatic deployment to production.  
  - Preview deployments are generated for every pull request → allows QA & stakeholder review before merging.  

**CI/CD Flow:**  
1. Developer pushes code → GitHub Actions runs tests & checks.  
2. Vercel automatically builds & deploys latest version.  
3. Production site is updated instantly with zero-downtime deployment.

## 🧪 Test Coverage


The CalisFun Web Frontend applies a **multi-layered testing strategy** to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### 🔍 Testing Scope
- **Unit Tests**  
  - For reusable components (buttons, forms, inputs).  
  - For hooks and utility functions.  

- **Integration Tests**  
  - Validating data flow between components and services.  
  - Example: Login → AuthContext → API service → UI update.  

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
  - Simulating real user flows such as:
    - Admin Login -> Manage User -> Manage Question -> CRU Question

---

### 🧪 Testing Tools
- **Vitest** → Unit & integration tests.  
- **React Testing Library** → Component rendering and user interaction tests.  

---

### 📊 Coverage Metrics
The test coverage reports are generated automatically under the `/coverage` folder.  
Metrics tracked:
- **Statements** → Percentage of code statements executed.  
- **Branches** → Conditional branches covered.  
- **Functions** → Functions invoked during tests.  
- **Lines** → Executed lines vs total lines.  

We already succedd to passed some of unit tests such as button test, shadcnui library test, navbar test, and etc. We also already manually tested our website and from user perspective we can know better about CalisFun and download the app. From the admin perspective we can manage users and questions for CalisFun.
